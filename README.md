# TSPTW using Parallel Stable NRPA

## Description

Implementation of a parallel Stable NRPA to solve the TSPTW as describe by Tristan Cazenave
in [Stabilized Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03563.pdf).

The implementation uses an actors model to handle the concurrent computation of the NRPA leaves (playout) and the
concurrent runs of different trees.

## Prerequisites

* [Golang](https://golang.org) 1.14+

You need to download the repository and place it in the src folder inside your GOPATH folder.

## Build

```
go build main.go
```

## Run

```
./main -cpuprof=nrpa.prof -runs=5 -all (args...)
```
